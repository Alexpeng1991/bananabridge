# MSTU 5003 Design Document (Ruichen Liu)

> Clone the template and upload to your our Github.

Write a **two page** design document where you explain your project. You should clearly explain the problem you're trying to solve. Be sure to describe the domain you're working with and the users you're trying to target. Remember that the point of your design document is that you can hand it off to any developer and theoretically they would be able to understand and build the program.

You'll be adding to your design document as you work towards your midterm due on **Nov 4, 2016**.


## Topic
*What is the subject at hand?*
Helping Chinese immigrant kids age from 6-12 to learn English within a more cross-culture setting 

*Which broader field(s) does this site apply to?*
langauge learning 
culture learning 

## Problem
*What is the problem you're trying to solve?*
Language barrier:

According to the U.S. Department of Education, the share of children aged five to seventeen living in families that speak a language other than English rose from 9 percent in 1979 to 21 percent in 2008. Of these children in non-English-language households, who represent 5 percent of all schoolaged youth in the United States, nearly one in four speaks English with difficulty. Research also shows that students who begin kindergarten with limited oral English proficiency fall behind native speakers in their reading ability, resulting in a substantial achievement gap by fifth grade.

Culture difference:

When immigrants leave their homeland and settle in another country, the new ways may be different from that of the old country. There are instances of bicultural conflicts that pose dilemmas for immigrant children. Teachers or parents may not even recognize the cultural basis of these dilemmas and may insist upon the child doing things according to their own upbringing and outlook, thus creating confusion and anxiety when the two authority figures do not agree. In this case, it is very essential for immigran children to over come the culture difference.

## Target Audience
*Who is your target audience? Describe in detail*
Audience: immigrant children
Age:6-12
Race: Chinese
langauge: Chinese: intermediate: can deal with simple key tasks  
		  English: Elementary proficiency: can deal with limited day-to-day activity 

These children moved to America with their parents from mother country and at least one of their parents are not proficient with English. These children are currently in primary and secondery schools which most of them are domained by American culture in English speaking environement. Immigrant chlidren in this situation need a better cultural adjusment and English improvement.
